NFLPool Developer Documentation
################################

NFLPool is a fantasy football like league.  Unlike fantasy football, where you need to draft a team and
manage your lineup on a weekly basis, in NFLPool you will pick teams and players and where you think they
will finish over the course of the National Football season.  You do not need to set any weekly lineups.

Developer documentation coming soon.
