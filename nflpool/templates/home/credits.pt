                <h2>Technical Details</h2>

                <p>NFLPool is built in Python using the Pyramid framework.  NFLPool is licensed under the GPLv3
                    and source code is available on Github.</p>

                <p>I started learning Python in early 2016 as a hobby with a goal of building the scoring
                automation for NFLPool and MLBPool2 instead of having to calculate each player's score manually.</p>

                <p>I couldn't have learned Python without the help of:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Python for Everyone on Coursera by Dr. Charles Severance, which taught me the basic
                        fundamentals of Python.</li>
                        <li>Talk Python Training by Michael Kennedy, host of the most popular Python podcast,
                        Talk Python.  His courses were key in the development of this website and I was able to apply
                        my Python knowledge thanks to the following courses:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Python Jumpstart by Building 10 Apps</li>
                                <li>Python for Entrepreneurs</li>
                                <li>Consuming HTTP Services in Python</li>
                                <li>MongoDB for Python for Developers</li>

                            </ul>
                        <li>Lastly, and most importantly, my wife, who has years of programming experience and put up
                        with all of my stupid questions.</li>
                    </ul>




                    <p>NFLPool is hosted on DigitalOcean running Fedora.  The site is built using:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Python 3.5.2</li>
                        <li>MongoDB</li>
                        <li>Bootstrap and the Start Bootstrap theme</li>
                        <li>Font Awesome</li>
                        <li>NFL Statistics provided by <a href="https://www.mysportsfeeds.com">MySportsFeeds</a></li>
                    </ul>
