# NFLPool

NFLPool is a variation of MLBPool hosted at [MLBPool2.com](http://mlbpool2.com).  Before the NFL season begins, players choose
the teams they believe will win and lose each division; wildcard winners; and which players will lead in certain
offensive and defensive statistics.  Points are assigned to each category and the player who has the most points at the end 
of the NFL season after week 17 wins.  Unlike MLBPool2, players do not have the ability to change their picks at the halfway
point of the season.

## nflpool application

The NFLPool application is written in Python.  Future iterations will include a web application to output the results
via JSON to be displayed on the web.
